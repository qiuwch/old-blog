I want an interactive gui programming environment for a long time.
Once I tried python-qt, but this seems not very friendly and elegant.

Today I want to do some computer vision experiment, and try to do some spotlight effect. After googling for a while, I found this stackoverflow post [Is Python any good for GUI development?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/115495/is-python-any-good-for-gui-development). wxPython seems more simple and elegant than python-qt.

And some demos and tutorials are available. eg:
* [wxPython tutorial](http://zetcode.com/wxpython/)
* [wxPython demos and samples](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/)

Which is helpful to get a brief view and have a quick start.
