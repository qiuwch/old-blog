* Efficient coding
* Stereo vision
* Saliency


As an engineer, I am trying to find something that can really work and can be applied to build intelligent machine.

There is some fact of vision and many assumption and theories.

Some important fact that:

* V1 is 100x larger than retina in terms of neuron counts
* V1's receptive field is tuned to orientation


I think human's vision has the ability of unsupervised learning, when you see something for a long period, your vision system is tuned to recognize that object more easily.

Theory of attention (both bottom-up and top-down) is supported by many experiments. In some kind of situation, vision is super fast compared with machine vision, like object recognition. But in some situation, human vision is slow, like finding the difference between two images.

In recognition task, human vision needs some "imagination" to recognize something that he never saw. Imagination is a mysterious word for science to explain. Maybe imagination is because neural network is a generative model, and the randomness of strength of neuron connection make the result sightly different

For an intelligent machine, we need to implement, (only add the absolutely necessary components)

1. Memory
2. Imagination

The ability
1. Learning

Too many to memory, how to memory efficiently

Border pixel density is sparse


Engineering: Problem driven
Science: Fact driven

Saliency cause:

1. Size
2. Color
3. Orientation

Why size and orientation can fire saliency ?


What's the distribution of receptive field in V1 ?
