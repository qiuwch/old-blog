Just got one year membership of AAAI.

This is because the popular online open course "Introduction to artificial intelligence" taught by [Peter Norvig](author:peter_norvig) and [Sebastian Thurun](author:sebastian_thurun). Before the beginning of this course, I saw a post told that those students who rank 10% of this course will be give AAAI membership for reward. I just took this as a rumor and use this to encourage myself to study hard in this course. Now months after this course, when I thought this is a real rumor, I got a mail told me that I am given a one year membership. That's really a good gift, lol.
